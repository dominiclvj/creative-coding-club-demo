# Why from() Tweens Glitch!

## Learning
So far I've shown you loads of cool things you can do with just a few GSAP basics. You may even think that with GSAP everything is easy and just works perfectly with a few lines of code!

That's mostly true, however, you're inevitably going to stumble into a few little traps along the way. This lesson is designed to keep you away from one of the most common beginner hang-ups.

So before watching the video I want you to experience the issue and perhaps try to solve it too!

In the browser on the right-hand side, the light background circle grows on mouse center. Move your cursor back and forth over the circle quickly.

Notice how the circle stops growing to its full size?

This is the glitch I'm going to show you how to fix in the video. If you need to refresh, just click the "rerun" button in the bottom right corner.

However, if you're feeling ambitious, try to fix it here before watching the video. If you run into trouble AFTER watching the video, you can see the solution here (no peeking!)
