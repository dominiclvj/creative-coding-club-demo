# Hello Creative Coding Club
Welcome to your JavaScript animation course. We've adapted your GSAP 3 Express course to showcase what is possible with [Teachstack](https://www.teachstack.io).

We've done our best to adapt the course as faithfully as possible. In many cases we've added some new explanatory text and simple exercises to check comprehension. We have made the first three lessons unskippable, so you must complete the exercise to proceed. The rest you can click through at your leisure.

While this is a relatively simple course, our platform allows the integration of more complex programming languages, including Java, C# and C++. We can also integrate various database technologies, such as SQL and MongoDB.

Please get in touch with any feedback by emailing dominic.jackson@teachstack.io, or using the [contact form](https://teachstack.io/contact) on our website.
