# Hello Creative Coding Club
Welcome to your JavaScript animation course. We've adapted your GSAP 3 Express course to showcase what is possible with [Teachstack](https://www.teachstack.io).

Animations in this course will be rendered in the browser on the right-hand side of the interface. Refreshing the browser will trigger animations. The browser can also be toggled open or closed

We've done our best to adapt the course as faithfully as possible. In some cases we've added some new explanatory text and simple exercises to check comprehension.

While this is a relatively simple course, our platform allows the integration of more complex programming languages, including Java, C# and C++. We can also integrate various database technologies, such as SQL and MongoDB.

Please get in touch with any feedback by emailing dominic.jackson@teachstack.io, or using the [contact form](https://teachstack.io/contact) on our website.
